# Inpainting with Cutmix and Generate YOLO label

## Overview
This project implements image inpainting using OpenCV's GrabCut algorithm combined with the CutMix technique. It enhances background images by pasting object images onto them, producing augmented images and labels in YOLO format.

## Project Structure
```
inpainting/

├── openCV_reference/       # Reference materials and examples using OpenCV
├── results/                # Directory where the augmented images and labels are stored
├── try/                    # Experimental scripts and trials
└── inpainting_with_label.py  # Main script to perform inpainting and label generation
```

## Requirements
- **Python 3.9.0**
- **OpenCV**

Install OpenCV and other necessary libraries with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless
# Ensure to add any other required packages
```

## Usage
To generate augmented images and labels:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Execute the following command:
```bash
python inpainting_with_label.py
```

## Output
The augmented images and corresponding YOLO formatted labels are saved in the `results` directory.
