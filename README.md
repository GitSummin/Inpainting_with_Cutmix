# Inpainting Project

## Overview
This project implements image inpainting using OpenCV's GrabCut algorithm combined with the CutMix technique. It allows for the augmentation of background images by pasting object images onto them. The output includes augmented images along with labels in YOLO format.

## Project Structure
inpainting/
│
├── openCV_reference/ # Reference materials and examples using OpenCV
├── results/ # Directory where the augmented images and labels are stored
├── try/ # Experimental scripts and trials
└── inpainting_with_label.py # Main script to perform inpainting and label generation

## Requirements
- Python 3.9.0
- OpenCV

To install OpenCV and other required libraries, run the following command:
pip install opencv-python-headless  # Add other necessary packages

## Usage
To run the inpainting script and generate augmented images and labels, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:
python inpainting_with_label.py

## Output
After running the script, the augmented images along with their corresponding YOLO formatted labels will be saved in the results directory.
